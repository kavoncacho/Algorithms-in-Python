Assignment 1, Question 1

The working program is Assignment1Q1.py, Assignment1Q1v2.py was made for testing purposes and works as intended, but merge sort
is written differently; the results are the same.

In order properly run the program, Python 3.0+ must be installed as well as the matplotlib library. matplotlib also requires 
additonal dependencies. More information about matplotlib installation can be found here: https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/installing.html

Three screenshots that show Insertion > Merge, Insertion = Merge, and Insertion < Merge have been included as well.
