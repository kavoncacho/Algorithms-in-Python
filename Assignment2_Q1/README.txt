Assignment 2, Question 1

The working program is Assignment2Q1.py

In order properly run the program, Python 3.0+ must be installed as well as the matplotlib library. matplotlib also requires 
additional dependencies. More information about matplotlib installation can be found here: https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/installing.html

Three screenshots that show Brute Force > Recursion, Brute Force = Recursion, and Brute Force < Recursion have been included as well.

The n at which Recursion overtakes Brute is roughly n = 30, as seen in the images.
